# Lauren-Neudorf-Atlanta-Hawks-Assessment

This repository contains my findings, resume, and R code/excel work for the Atlanta Hawks Data Analyst Assessment. Additionally, it includes a PDF copy of the R Code rmd file. Some work was completed in R particularly those in part 1. Part 2 was primarily calculated in Excel.
